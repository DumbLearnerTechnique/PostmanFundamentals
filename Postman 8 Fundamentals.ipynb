    "\n",
    "- Welcome to GLOBOMANTICS (e-commerce company)\n",
    "- We have APIs for just about everything from buying our products, adding new items to our inventory, and collecting payments\n",
    "- We also have APIs that are available for consumers to use, allowing our users to build up a home library as an example\n",
    "- **Teams that'll help the new Employee:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Front-end (client-facing Applications) Team:**\n",
    "        - Roman is an Application developer\n",
    "        - He uses APIs to give our customers an amazing integrated experience across our product line. \n",
    "        - But he is not the one who actually creates new APIs \n",
    "        - Roman loves that he can use Postman to mock out data when the API isn't quite ready yet\n",
    "        - Roman also figured out how to use Postman to get his application set up just right without needing to click through bunch of screens entering data\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Back End API Team:**\n",
    "        - Ana is an API developer\n",
    "        - She created one of the APIs for us, she also guides a team of API developers on their design and implementation of new APIs\n",
    "        - Ana loves how easy Postman make it to test various API calls. She's also a fan of how Postman can help make sure the API documentation is up to date\n",
    "        \n",
    "- Both Ana and Roman will help the new Employee improve his efficiency by using Postman, they will show how much Postman simplifies working with APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** No matter which Team, employee will be very familiar with GLOBOMANTICS APIs\n",
